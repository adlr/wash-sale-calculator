"Example 1. You buy 100 shares of X stock
for $1,000. You sell these shares for $750 and
within 30 days from the sale you buy 100
shares of the same stock for $800. Because
you bought substantially identical stock, you
cannot deduct your loss of $250 on the sale.
However, you add the disallowed loss of $250
to the cost of the new stock, $800, to obtain
your basis in the new stock, which is $1,050."
