"Example. During 2008, you bought 100
shares of X stock on each of three occasions.
You paid $158 a share for the first block of 100
shares, $100 a share for the second block, and
$95 a share for the third block. On December
27, 2013, you sold 300 shares of X stock for
$125 a share. On January 9, 2014, you bought
250 shares of identical X stock. You cannot deduct
the loss of $33 a share on the first block
because within 30 days after the date of sale
you bought 250 identical shares of X stock. In
addition, you cannot reduce the gain realized
on the sale of the second and third blocks of
stock by this loss."
