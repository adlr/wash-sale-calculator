Here's What They Say
IRS Publication 550 contains the following statement:

Loss from a wash sale of one block of stock or securities cannot be
used to reduce any gains on identical blocks sold the same day.

It Doesn't Apply Here
Here's an example of a common situation where this statement does not
apply:

A day trader buys 100 XYZ and sells it the same day at a loss. Later
that day, he again buys 100 XYZ and sells it at a gain.

It's clear that the wash sale rule applies to the first sale, because
it's a loss with replacement stock bought within 30 days. The
disallowed loss is added to the basis of the second block of stock and
reduces the gain (or turns the gain into a loss). The IRS will not
prevent you from offsetting the gain with the loss in this situation,
even though both sales took place on the same day.
