"Example 2. You bought 100 shares of M
stock on September 26, 2013. On February 6,
2014, you sold those shares at a $1,000 loss.
On each of the 4 days from February 11, 2014,
to February 14, 2014, you bought 50 shares of
substantially identical stock. You cannot deduct
your $1,000 loss. You must add half the disallowed
loss ($500) to the basis of the 50 shares
bought on February 11. Add the other half
($500) to the basis of the shares bought on
February 12."
