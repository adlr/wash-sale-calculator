2: Selling Half
On June 1 you buy 200 shares of XYZ for $10,000. On June 12 you sell
100 shares for $4,000 (a loss of $1,000). You continue to hold the
other 100 shares.

The answer here is a little less obvious. After the sale, you hold
shares identical to the shares you sold, and you bought those shares
less than 31 days before the sale. But you probably still feel that
the wash sale rule shouldn't apply here. And the IRS agrees, in the
situation where you bought the 200 shares in a single
lot. Furthermore, although the IRS doesn't say this, the result
shouldn't change if you gave a single buy order for 200 and your
broker happened to execute it by buying two lots of 100 shares
each. It's clear the shares you have left after the sale weren't
bought to replace the shares you sold.
