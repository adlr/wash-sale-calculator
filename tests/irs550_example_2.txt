"Example 1. You bought 100 shares of M
stock on September 26, 2013, for $5,000. On
December 19, 2013, you bought 50 shares of
substantially identical stock for $2,750. On December
27, 2013, you bought 25 shares of substantially
identical stock for $1,125. On January
9, 2014, you sold for $4,000 the 100 shares you
bought in September. You have a $1,000 loss
on the sale. However, because you bought 75
shares of substantially identical stock within 30
days before the sale, you cannot deduct the
loss ($750) on 75 shares. You can deduct the
loss ($250) on the other 25 shares. The basis of
the 50 shares bought on December 19, 2013, is
increased by two-thirds (50 รท 75) of the $750
disallowed loss. The new basis of those shares
is $3,250 ($2,750 + $500). The basis of the 25
shares bought on December 27, 2013, is increased
by the rest of the loss to $1,375
($1,125 + $250)."
