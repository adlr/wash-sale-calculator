Calculator for wash sales for US taxes

Note that the author is not a CPA or tax expert. This program most certainly contains bugs.

To use, you'll need a CSV file with the initial state. I've provided a dummy one called `dummy_example.csv`.

To use the program from a terminal, run:

`python wash.py -w dummy_example.csv -o out.csv`

To verify that all the tests pass:

`python run_tests.py`
